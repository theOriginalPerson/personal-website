For my internship at Better Resto (<a href="www.betterresto.com" target="_blank">check them out here</a>), one of the things my supervisor recommended to better acclimate myself to their tech stack was to build a full-stack website for a fictional restaurant.

I chose Los Pollos Hermanos, because why not? 

Since we were using Gatsby (a static site generator) and Strapi (a static content-management system, or CMS), I needed some time to figure out how to code with their tech before I could actually contribute to the company's projects.

Within a month and a half of tinkering and programming various components, I became confident in my ability to actually contribute to actual company projects. 

One of my tasks further on involved connecting each of the restaurant's locations and franchises to a Google Maps query, as well as taking messages from customers and potential franchisees.
