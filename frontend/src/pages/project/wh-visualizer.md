Due to the nature of this project, I cannot disclose certain specificities, and so I refer you to contact my references (which you can ask upon request).

Under the guidance of the IDEAWORKS IoT and Sensors lab at Mohawk College, I developed a 3D warehouse visualizer for a client company using C#, .NET Framework and Unity. I architected the system from the ground-up, and I followed an MVC style, with pattern-oriented software architecture.
