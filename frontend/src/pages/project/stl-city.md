In 2022, I came up with a business idea for a 3D printing manufacturer that would essentially act like an Uber between 3D printer owners. 

The gist was that you'd have people who had 3D printers, and people who didn't. The people that were technically inclined could provide a service to those who needed something custom-built, and so STL City was born.

I developed this landing page ASAP in order to gain some traction, but once I learned that the market was not large enough to support and fund the idea, there was no point in furthering it. I still keep the website open as a means to show off my frontend design and building skills.

I used Google Forms as a way to collect user data and feedback, as well as a sign-up sheet.
