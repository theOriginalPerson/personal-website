My friend and I (but mostly my friend) had launched an XR club for staff and students to enjoy. Naturally, what fun would XR be without software development?

Over a weekend I ended up programming the developer documentation page where our devs will showcase their documented work.

Using Strapi for the backend and Astro for the frontend, students will be able to easily upload their work through an online server that automatically updates the website without any need for manual uploading!
