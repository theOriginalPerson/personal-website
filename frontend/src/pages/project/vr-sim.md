In 2018, I was taking a neuropsychology course that required me to develop some sort of project that would either illustrate or explain the effects of a neurodegenerative disorder of our choice.

Our group chose to do Parkinson's, and we ended up deciding to go all out. Instead of choosing to create a project board, PowerPoint presentation, or something traditional, we decided to make an app. Except none of us knew how to code.

In order to get this completed in under a month's time, we had to divide the tasks up into who could do the technical side of things, and who could do the presentation side of things. I chose to do the technical side of things since I had some exposure to HTML/CSS, and at the time I was naive enough to think this would get me through the project ðŸ˜¬.

Fast forward a month and thousands of Google searches later, I developed a full-scale Android app using Unity and C# in order to complete the task. Visit the link provided above to see it in the Google Play Store!
