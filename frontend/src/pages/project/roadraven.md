This project is still underway, and I will provide updates on the community discord (you can join through RoadRaven's link I provided above, under "Get Started").

The inspiration behind this project was to generate something that people would reap benefits from when driving. I figured we could map more of our roads in real-time if we put our heads (and dashcams) together.

This is currently my largest endeavour yet and I plan on developing a mobile application for both iOS and Android devices.
